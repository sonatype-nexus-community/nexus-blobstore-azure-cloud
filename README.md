Nexus Repository Azure Cloud Storage Blobstore
==============================

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers](https://badges.gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers.svg)](https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This project adds [Azure Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.Azure.com/storage/) backed blob stores to Sonatype Nexus 
Repository 3.16 and later.  It allows Nexus Repository to store the components and assets in Azure Cloud instead of a
local filesystem.

Installation
------------
While nexus is stopped, copy target/nexus-blobstore-azure-cloud-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar in the deploy folder in your
nexus 3 distribution. Start nexus and the plugin will be installed.

Log in as admin and create a new blobstore, selecting 'Azure Cloud Storage' as the type.

The Fine Print
--------------

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to Azure Cloud support
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using this plugin and the Nexus platform, we are glad to have you here!
