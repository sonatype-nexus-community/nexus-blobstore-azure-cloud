Nexus Repository Azure Blob Storage Blobstore
==============================

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers](https://badges.gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers.svg)](https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This project adds [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) backed blob stores to Sonatype Nexus Repository 3.16 and later. It allows Nexus Repository to store the components and assets in Azure Blobs instead of a local filesystem.

Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------
Go read [our contribution guidelines](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get a bit more familiar with how we would like things to flow.

Requirements
------------
* [Apache Maven 3.3.3+](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* [Java 8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* Network access to https://repository.sonatype.org/content/groups/sonatype-public-grid

Building
--------
To build the project and generate the bundle use Maven:

    mvn clean package -PbuildKar

Creating Docker Image bundled with Azure Blob Storage Plugin
-------------------------------------------------------
To create a docker image and run it with the Azure Blob Storage plugin baked in, run the following commands: 

    mvn clean package -PbuildKar
    docker build -t nexus3_azure .
    docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus3azure -v nexus3azure-data:/nexus-data nxrm_azure:latest
    

Integration Tests
-----------------
To run integration commands, activate the `it` profile and include the system properties `nxrm.azure.accountName` and 
`Dnxrm.azure.accountKey`. Integration tests will create temporary storage containers and tests should cleanup when 
complete. If you're running tests often check your storage account because it is likely that some containers may be left
behind and not properly cleanup up by the tests. 

     mvn clean install -P it -Dnxrm.azure.accountName=<accountName> -Dnxrm.azure.accountKey=<accountKey>


Azure Blob Storage Permissions
--------------------------------
TODO

Azure Blob Storage Authentication

Installation
------------
While nexus is stopped, copy target/nexus-blobstore-azure-cloud-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar in the deploy folder in your
nexus 3 distribution. Start nexus and the plugin will be installed.

Log in as admin and create a new blobstore, selecting 'Azure Cloud Storage' as the type.

The Fine Print
--------------

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have. 
* There are some incomplete features and known issues.
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to Azure blobstore support
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using this plugin and the Nexus platform, we are glad to have you here!
